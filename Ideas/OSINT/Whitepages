#Whitepages API integration

#need a Whitepages pro account to accuse the API0
#and persinaly paying for shit is overrated

#You can get a key for free

#how?

#don't worry about it, i'll work on  getting the API key.

# "" 1. Have pyphiser working with automatic port forwarding \
2. Have the whitepages modules grab the info and put into a file
3. Get more members to work on this
4. Have this program install to the computer and runable from typing watchmen
5. Raspberry Pi integration is broken. This will be fixed in future updates. 
6. We are working on getting a cnam api for reverse phone lookup
"" IN regards to 4, cant we just impletment the command "chmod +x" to the actual script?
