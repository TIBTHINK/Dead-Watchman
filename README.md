# Dead-Watchman
OSINT Program, makes stalking faster than ever


## Installing Deppendecies

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 watchmen.py
```

## Things That Need To Work Out

1. have pyphiser working with automatic port forwarding \
2. have the whitepages modules grab the info and put into a file
3. get more members to work on this
4. have this program install to the computer and runable from typing watchmen

# disclaimer

This program was writen and tested in linux, \
not all options in dead watchmen will work coss-platform \
it is in the works to make it cross platform \
(probally not gonna happen because im lazy)
