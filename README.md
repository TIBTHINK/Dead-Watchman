OSINT Program, makes stalking faster than ever

## Things That Need To Work Out

1. Have pyphiser working with automatic port forwarding
2. Have the whitepages modules grab the info and put into a file
3. Get more members to work on this
4. Have this program install to the computer and runable from typing watchmen \
<s>5. Raspberry Pi 3 integration is broken. This will be fixed in future updates.</s>
6. We are working on getting a cnam api for reverse phone lookup \
7. put this in for phishing \
