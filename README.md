# Dead-Watchman
OSINT Program, makes stalking faster than ever


## Installing on a normal computer

```
git clone https://github.com/guardsec/Dead-Watchmen.git
cd Dead-Watchmen
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
sudo python3 watchmen.py
```

## Installing on Termux

## Things That Need To Work Out

1. Have pyphiser working with automatic port forwarding
2. Have the whitepages modules grab the info and put into a file
3. Get more members to work on this
4. Have this program install to the computer and runable from typing watchmen
5. Raspberry Pi integration is broken. This will be fixed in future updates. 
6. We are working on getting a cnam api for reverse phone lookup
